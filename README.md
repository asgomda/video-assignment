# VID-E-OH!- Assignment 4
### Project Name:
*Who Stole the Trophy at NYUAD?*


### Project Description: 
*what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.*

We chose option 1 from the assignment prompt. Our project is about a mystery crime that happened in NYUAD campus and the viewers are following the investigation of solving this crime with a surprising ending. We wanted the viewers to be immersed in the investigation so we combined video's and interactivity pages to engage the viewer in the investigation.

### Process: 
*How did you go about implementing the concept.*

1. Drafting the story: We decided to choose option 1 from the prompt and make our main location NYUAD.
2. Writing the script and seperating the scenes for shooting
3. Making a wireframe
4. Filming and recording audio: We booked the camera and all the equipment and shot the scenes in several days. While filming, we also were using the zom audio recorder.
5. Editing the video and audio: We synced the audio and video using Adobe Premiere (We were able to do that because we used the clap technique that made it easier to align the ausio and video).
6. Working on the website
