We chose option 1 from the assignment prompt. Our project is about a mystery crime that happened in NYUAD campus and the viewers are following the investigation of solving this crime with a surprising ending. We wanted the viewers to be immersed in the investigation so we combined video's and interactivity pages to engage the viewer in the investigation.
