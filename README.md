# VID-E-OH!- Assignment 4
### Project Name:
*Title*

### Project Description: 
*what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.*

We chose option 1 from the assignment prompt. Our project is about a mystery crime that happened in NYUAD campus and the viewers are following the investigation of solving this crime with a surprising ending. We wanted the viewers to be immersed in the investigation so we combined video's and interactivity pages to engage the viewer in the investigation.

### Process: 
*How did you go about implementing the concept.*

### Reflection/Evaluation: 
*This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.*
